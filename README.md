# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify patterns and factors influencing churn, enabling businesses to implement targeted retention strategies.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Understand the data through visualizations and statistical analysis
- Feature engineering: Select and engineer relevant features for modeling
- Model selection: Choose the best machine learning algorithm for churn prediction
- Model evaluation: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics
- Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions

## Data
The dataset used for this project can be found in `Customer_churn_dataset.csv`. It contains various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and churn status
